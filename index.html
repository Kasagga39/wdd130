        <img src="IMAGE/uganda.webp" alt="The Pearl of Africa">
        <p>Uganda, often called the "Pearl of Africa," is a land of breathtaking beauty and rich culture, where the
            mighty River Nile begins its journey and wildlife roams freely across lush savannahs and misty forests.
            Uganda's savannas, wetlands, and rainforests contribute to the country's remarkable natural beauty. With
            warm hospitality and a deep love for their homeland, Ugandans carry forward the spirit of a country that
            truly shines as Africa’s most precious gem.</p>
